## DisCatSharp 9.X Documentation
[DisCatSharp](https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/DisCatSharp) (D#+NG) is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro "Discord API") which was originally a fork of [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus).<br/>
The library has since been rewritten to fit quality and API standards as well as target wider range of .NET implementations. Furthermore this lib will be the most up-to-date.

## Getting Started
New users will want to take a look through the [articles](xref:preamble) for quick start guides, tutorials, and examples of use.<br/>
Once you've gotten through the articles, head on over to the [API Documentation](/api/index.html) for all classes and methods provided by this library.
